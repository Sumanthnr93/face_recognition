This is a small demonstration of transfer learning 
Model : VGG16\
\
Using OpenCV real time facial identification and recognition has been demostrated. \
All the materials have been provided. 
To try out for yourself.\
Add images to custom_images folder and name the images with the required name. \
If the face has been recognized it will display the name else it will show "Unknown"

Is this the accurate model ? \
Model is good, but using a single laptop webcam it becomes poor in recognition.\
Real time analysis will improve with dual camera

ToDo
Try to implement over raspberry pi using pi cam and TensorflowLite
